## Problem Title
# SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
# 1. Problem Statement
Pig and poultry farms are highly susceptible to disease outbreaks which can cause major economic losses. Good biosecurity practices are essential to prevent, contain, and report infections quickly—but small farms often lack the tools and knowledge needed to monitor and implement biosecurity protocols.

# 2. Proposed Solution
Our project proposes a Digital Farm Management Portal designed for pig and poultry farmers. The portal will:
Provide easy guidelines, step-by-step checklists, and video tutorials for disease prevention
Allow farmers to log health data, feed schedules, cleaning routines, and visitor information
Send automated reminders for routine biosecurity tasks (like cleaning, vaccination, feed checks)
Alert authorities or experts in case of symptoms or suspected outbreaks
Offer a dashboard overview of farm status, historical trends, and recommendations

# 3. Technical Approach
Tech Stack: Python backend (Django/Flask), React front-end, MySQL database, and cloud hosting (AWS/Azure/GCP).
Main Components:
User authentication for farmers
Data entry forms for farm activities and animal health
Notification module (SMS/email alerts)
Dashboard for visualizing daily farm status and risks
Workflow: Users log in → Enter daily routines and observations → System tracks compliance and health alerts → Reports are generated and shared with relevant authorities.

# 4. Feasibility and Challenges
The portal is feasible using current low-cost cloud and web technologies. Key challenges:
Ensuring easy usage for farmers with limited technical skills
Data privacy and secure storage
Reliable internet access in rural regions
Mitigations:
Design intuitive mobile app interface in local languages
Offline data entry with sync when connected
Strict access controls and encrypted data

# 5. Impact and Benefits
Social: Reduces disease spread, improves farmer livelihood and farm worker safety.
Economic: Less disease-related loss, increased productivity from better animal health.
Environmental: Better waste management and cleaner farms reduce pollution risks.
